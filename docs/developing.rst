Developing with GeoMesa
=======================

Project Structure
-----------------

The GeoMesa source distribution is divided into several submodules:

* **geomesa-accumulo**: the implementations of the core Accumulo indexing structures, Accumulo iterators, and the GeoTools interfaces for exposing the functionality as a ``DataStore`` to both application developers and GeoServer.
* **geomesa-assemble**: packages the GeoMesa distributed runtime, GeoMesa GeoServer plugin, and GeoMesa Tools. You can manually assemble using the ``assemble.sh`` script contained in the module.
* **geomesa-compute**: utilities for working with distributed computing environments. Currently, there are methods for instantiating an Apache Spark Resilient Distributed Dataset from a CQL query against data stored in GeoMesa. Eventually, this project will contain bindings for traditional map-reduce processing, Scalding, and other environments.
* **geomesa-convert**: a configurable and extensible library for converting data into SimpleFeatures.
* **geomesa-distributed-runtime**: assembles a jar with dependencies that must be distributed to Accumulo tablet servers lib/ext directory or to an HDFS directory where Accumulo's VFSClassLoader can pick it up.
* **geomesa-examples**: includes Developer quickstart tutorials and examples for how to work with GeoMesa in Accumulo and Kafka.
* **geomesa-features**: includes code for serializing SimpleFeatures and custom SimpleFeature implementations designed for GeoMesa.
* **geomesa-filter**: a library for manipulating and working with GeoTools Filters.
* **geomesa-hbase**: an implementation of GeoMesa on HBase and Google Cloud Bigtable.
* **geomesa-jobs**: map/reduce and scalding jobs for maintaining GeoMesa.
* **geomesa-kafka**: an implementation of GeoMesa in Kafka for maintaining near-real-time caches of streaming data.
* **geomesa-plugin**: creates a plugin which provides WFS and WMS support. The JAR named geomesa-plugin-|version|-geoserver-plugin.jar is ready to be deployed in GeoServer by copying it into ``geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/``.
* **geomesa-process**: analytic processes optimized on GeoMesa data stores.
* **geomesa-raster**: adds support for ingesting and working with geospatially-referenced raster data in GeoMesa.
* **geomesa-security**: adds support for managing security and authorization levels for data stored in GeoMesa. 
* **geomesa-stream**: a GeoMesa library that provides tools to process streams of `SimpleFeatures`.
* **geomesa-tools**: a set of command line tools for managing features, ingesting and exporting data, configuring tables, and explaining queries in GeoMesa.
* **geomesa-utils**: stores our GeoHash implementation and other general library functions unrelated to Accumulo. This sub-project contains any helper tools for geomesa. Some of these tools such as the GeneralShapefileIngest have Map/Reduce components, so the geomesa-utils JAR lives on HDFS.
* **geomesa-web**: web services for accessing GeoMesa.
* **geomesa-z3**: the implementation of Z3, GeoMesa's space-filling Z-order curve.

Installing the Build Tools
--------------------------

Using Maven

TODO

Using the Scala Console
-----------------------

To test and interact with core functionality, the Scala console can be invoked in a couple of ways. For example, by
running this command in the root source directory:  

    $ cd geomesa-accumulo
    $ mvn -pl geomesa-accumulo-datastore scala:console

The Scala console will start, and all of the project packages in ``geomesa-accumulo-datastore`` will be loaded along
with ``JavaConversions`` and ``JavaConverters``.
