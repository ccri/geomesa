Introduction

About
-----

GeoMesa is an open-source, distributed, spatio-temporal database built on top
of the Apache Accumulo (http://accumulo.apache.org/) column family store. GeoMesa implements standard
Geotools (http://geotools.org/) interfaces to provide geospatial functionality over very large data
sets to application developers.  GeoMesa provides plugins for exposing
geospatial data stored in Accumulo via standards-based OGC HTTP services and
cluster monitoring and management tools within the GeoServer administrative
interface.
